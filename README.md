I am Marc Gallardo Quesada, a student in the [Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/cat/estudis/graus-videojocs/). This research is generated for the second year’s subject Project II.

In this project, I will be covering the basic concepts of balancing an RTS game and taking a deep dive in the complexity that they  carry. Furthermore, I will explain some of the methods used in order to reach our desired objective.

## [Unit Balancing Spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s6JRnOOyAR3XHey6yj2iO6kdcxu8GNO1/view?usp=sharing)

To download it, click on the link above.

I've provided this spreadsheet for anyone to be able to balance his troops. It takes into consideration:
- The cost
- The HP
- The damage
- The range

*Disclaimer: I've modified and adapted the spreadsheet done by the user [HappyCoder](https://www.gamedev.net/forums/topic/685693-rts-unit-balance/?do=findComment&comment=5329145) to my needs. All credits goes to him.*

*Special thanks to Victor Chen: I've done a research on my own following this example of the student [Victor Chen](https://github.com/Scarzard/RTS_Balancing) taking in his research, adptapting it and adding my own to perfect it.*
